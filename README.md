6) She may enter marks
7) She may view a student's performance report (including marks obtained in each evaluation along with a total).

Also,the three-tier architecture is being followed in which the Data from interfaces shall move into the objects, which later can be saved in files.

All the related files have been attached for the convienience.
That is all. Hope you like my work.

Thank you.
